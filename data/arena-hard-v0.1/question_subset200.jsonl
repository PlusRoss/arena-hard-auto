The latest attempt includes trying batch sizes of 512, 1024, and 2048 while keeping the block size  at a 4. All of this is done in the context of nanoGPT. It's worth noting that when I ran a batch size of 12 and a block size of 1024, I managed to get the loss down to 4.32 after 10,000 iterations. In your opinion and experience, what steps can I take in order to reduce the loss? Please keep in mind that my video card has 12GB of RAM and the vocabulary is made up of 20,000 words. Each sentence is made up of exactly four tokens. Do you have any suggestions how I could improve the neural network, please?"}]}
