Write a query term that prcisely completes the request..\n  \n  If you can't figure out the correct search term just say so. \n\n  Use the template and samples in the given context and information provided in the question to write query terms:\n\n  Context: To find properties that has a value within a given range, range queries ca be done using the following format <key> > \"<value>\" <key> >= \"<value>\" Can replace > with <. Sample search term: NUMBER_OF_RECORDS >= \"18\" Sample search term: NULL_COUNT < \"15\"\n\nFollowing searches can be used for fuzzy search <key> ~= \"<value>\" <key> LIKE \"<value>\" <key> ~= \"(?i)<value>\" <key> ~= \"(?-i)<value>\" Fuzzy search works by matching entire patterns specified.

You can supply multiple answers in successive iterations. You are allowed to run a simulation after 2 iterations. After each analysis, provide a reflection on the accuracy and completeness so we might improve in another iteration.  If so, end a reply with \"CONTINUE TO ITERATION [x]\" and wait for my input. When there is no more accuracy or completeness issue left to resolve and the mathematical analysis agrees with the simulation results, please end by typing \"SOLVED\". Always end with either \"CONTINUE TO ITERATION [x]\" or \"SOLVED\"."}]}
